SPA Restyling
I had a go at re-styling the bootstrap of the SPA, playing with the nav.
I've deleted the links and moved their functionality in the actual dark nav, for UI reasons. I've also re-styled the sign in - one, sign in - two, sign in - three so it fits nicely in the layout, under the col-3

I however struggled as I didn't make it to make the dropdown menu work :(
